You can get half off the original price, which means you can snag the Call of Duty: Black Ops Ultimate Edition for only $46.54 instead of $66.46. That's a great deal for one of the most popular games in the franchise. I'm tempted to join PlayStation Plus for a year and take advantage of this offer.
  
But Call of Duty is not the only bundle you can get with PlayStation Plus. There are also bundles for Assassin's Creed, FIFA, Grand Theft Auto, and more. You can find the full list of bundles on the PlayStation Store website. There's something for everyone, whether you like action, sports, or adventure.

PlayStation Plus is more than just a way to save money on games. It also gives you access to online multiplayer, cloud storage, and monthly free games. You can play with your friends online, backup your game data, and discover new titles every month. It's a great way to enhance your gaming experience and have more fun.
  
So what are you waiting for? These bundles are only available until May 2nd, so don't miss this chance to get some awesome games at a fraction of the cost. And if you're not a PlayStation Plus member yet, you can sign up for a 14-day free trial and see what you're missing. Trust me, you won't regret it.
