Dakar 18 is not only a game for hardcore racing fans, but also for casual gamers who want to explore the vast and diverse landscapes of South America. You can choose to follow the official route of the rally or go off-road and discover hidden secrets and treasures. You can also play online with other players or in split-screen mode with a friend.
 
Whether you prefer to ride a bike, drive a car, pilot a truck, or control a quad or a SSV, Dakar 18 has something for everyone. The game aims to be the most realistic and authentic representation of the Dakar rally ever made. Are you ready to take on the challenge?
  
One of the main features of Dakar 18 is the realistic navigation system. Unlike other racing games, you don't have a mini-map or a GPS to guide you. Instead, you have to rely on your road book and your compass to find your way. The road book contains all the information you need to follow the route, such as distances, headings, landmarks and hazards. You have to pay attention to the road book and the environment, and adjust your speed and direction accordingly.
 
Another feature of Dakar 18 is the dynamic weather and time system. The game simulates the changing weather conditions and the day and night cycle of the rally. You can encounter rain, fog, sandstorms, heat waves and more. The weather can affect your visibility, your vehicle performance and your navigation. You also have to deal with the fatigue and stress of driving for long hours in harsh conditions.
 
A third feature of Dakar 18 is the vehicle damage and repair system. The game tracks the damage of every part of your vehicle, such as tires, engine, suspension, brakes and more. You can see the damage indicators on your dashboard and hear the sounds of your vehicle deteriorating. You have to manage your damage and decide when to stop and repair your vehicle. You can also help other competitors who are stuck or broken down, or ask for their help if you need it.
