# How to Install and Use EA Cricket 07 Stroke Variation Patch V1 2
 
EA Cricket 07 is a popular cricket video game that was released in 2006. The game features realistic graphics, gameplay, and commentary. However, some players may find the game too easy or repetitive, especially when it comes to batting. That's why some modders have created a patch that adds more variety and challenge to the batting strokes.
 
The patch is called EA Cricket 07 Stroke Variation Patch V1 2, and it was created by Tutsi, a well-known modder in the cricket gaming community. The patch modifies the game files to enable more stroke options for the batsmen, such as reverse sweep, upper cut, scoop, switch hit, and more. The patch also adjusts the difficulty and accuracy of the bowling AI, making the game more realistic and challenging.
