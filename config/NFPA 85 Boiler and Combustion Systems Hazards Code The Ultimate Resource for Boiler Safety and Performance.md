# How to Comply with NFPA 85: Boiler and Combustion Systems Hazards Code
 
If you operate boilers with greater than 12.5 MMBTUH, pulverized fuel systems, or heat recovery steam generators, you need to comply with NFPA 85: Boiler and Combustion Systems Hazards Code. This code provides guidelines for safe operation and maintenance of these systems, as well as prevention of explosions and implosions that can cause serious injuries and property damage.

NFPA 85 is a comprehensive code that covers all aspects of boiler and combustion systems hazards, such as fuel storage and handling, combustion controls, burner management systems, interlocks, alarms, emergency shutdowns, fire protection, inspection, testing, and training. The code also addresses specific requirements for different types of boilers and combustion systems, such as single burner boilers, multiple burner boilers, stoker fired boilers, pulverized fuel systems, fluidized bed combustion systems, and heat recovery steam generators.
 
To comply with NFPA 85, you need to follow the steps below:
 
1. Obtain a copy of the current edition of NFPA 85 from the NFPA website[^1^]. The current edition is 2023.
2. Review the scope and applicability of the code to determine which sections apply to your specific boiler and combustion system.
3. Conduct a hazard analysis of your boiler and combustion system to identify potential risks and mitigation measures.
4. Implement the required safety measures and procedures according to the code provisions. This may include installing or upgrading equipment, modifying or updating controls, providing adequate ventilation and fire protection, conducting regular inspection and testing, and training personnel.
5. Maintain records of your compliance activities and documentation of your hazard analysis.
6. Submit a public input for the next edition of NFPA 85 if you have any suggestions for improvement or clarification of the code.

By complying with NFPA 85, you can ensure the safety of your boiler and combustion system and protect your employees, customers, and property from potential hazards.

## Examples of Boiler and Combustion Systems Hazards
 
Boiler and combustion systems hazards can result from various factors, such as improper design, installation, operation, maintenance, or modification of the system. Some examples of hazards that can cause fires, explosions, or implosions are:

- Accumulation of combustible dust in the boiler room, ducts, or equipment. Combustible dust can ignite when exposed to an ignition source, such as sparks, flames, or hot surfaces. The resulting fire can spread rapidly and cause a pressure rise that can rupture the boiler or ducts. Wood dust is a common combustible dust in the timber products industry[^2^].
- Lack of adequate combustion air supply or ventilation. Insufficient air can cause incomplete combustion, resulting in carbon monoxide formation and accumulation. Carbon monoxide is a flammable and toxic gas that can ignite or explode when mixed with air. Excessive air can also cause problems, such as increased heat loss, reduced efficiency, and increased emissions.
- Malfunction or failure of combustion controls or burner management systems. These systems are designed to regulate the fuel and air supply, monitor the flame condition, and provide safety interlocks and alarms. If these systems fail or are bypassed, the boiler or combustion system can operate in an unsafe manner, leading to uncontrolled fuel flow, flame instability, flame failure, or loss of flame detection.
- Improper use or storage of flammable liquids or gases near the boiler or combustion system. Flammable liquids or gases can leak or spill and create a vapor cloud that can ignite or explode when exposed to an ignition source. Examples of flammable liquids or gases include gasoline, diesel, propane, natural gas, and hydrogen.
- Inadequate fire protection or emergency shutdown procedures. Fire protection systems, such as sprinklers, extinguishers, and fire doors, are essential to prevent the spread of fire and protect personnel and property. Emergency shutdown procedures are also important to isolate the fuel supply and shut down the boiler or combustion system safely in case of an emergency.

To prevent these hazards from occurring, it is important to comply with NFPA 85 and follow the recommended practices for design, installation, operation, maintenance, and modification of boiler and combustion systems.
