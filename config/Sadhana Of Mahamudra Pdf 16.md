The Sadhana of Mahamudra is a meditation practice that was composed by the Tibetan Buddhist master ChÃ¶gyam Trungpa Rinpoche in 1967. It is a powerful and profound way of cutting through the obstacles and delusions that prevent us from experiencing our true nature, which is the state of mahamudra.

Mahamudra means "great seal" or "great symbol" in Sanskrit. It refers to the ultimate reality that is beyond words and concepts, but can be directly perceived by the mind. Mahamudra is also the name of a lineage of teachings and practices that aim to help us realize this reality.
 
The Sadhana of Mahamudra combines elements from different traditions of Tibetan Buddhism, such as Vajrayana, Kagyu, Nyingma, and Shambhala. It is a short and concise text that can be recited aloud or silently, alone or in a group. It consists of four main sections:
 
- The Invocation: This is a prayer to invoke the blessings and inspiration of the lineage masters and deities who are associated with mahamudra.
- The Main Practice: This is the core of the sadhana, where we visualize ourselves as a deity called Dorje TrolÃ¶, who represents the fearless and wrathful aspect of our own enlightened mind. We also recite a mantra that helps us dissolve our ego and connect with the primordial wisdom of mahamudra.
- The Supplication: This is a request to the guru and the lineage masters to grant us their realization and guidance.
- The Dedication: This is a way of sharing the merit and benefits of our practice with all sentient beings.

The Sadhana of Mahamudra can be practiced by anyone who has received an empowerment or permission from a qualified teacher. It is especially recommended to practice it on the new and full moon days, when the energy is more conducive for meditation. The sadhana can also be used as a funeral liturgy for those who have passed away.

The Sadhana of Mahamudra is not only a meditation practice, but also a visionary poem that reveals the essence of the Buddhist teachings. It was written by ChÃ¶gyam Trungpa Rinpoche during a retreat in Bhutan, where he received a series of visions and insights from the legendary Tibetan yogi Padmasambhava. The sadhana expresses the urgency and importance of overcoming the three lords of materialism, which are the forces that keep us trapped in samsara, the cycle of suffering.
 
The three lords of materialism are the lord of form, the lord of speech, and the lord of mind. The lord of form refers to our attachment to physical objects and pleasures. The lord of speech refers to our reliance on words and concepts to define ourselves and reality. The lord of mind refers to our tendency to manipulate and rationalize our experience according to our ego. These three lords prevent us from seeing the true nature of things, which is empty, luminous, and blissful.

The Sadhana of Mahamudra teaches us how to overcome these three lords by using their own energy against them. By visualizing ourselves as Dorje TrolÃ¶, we transform our ordinary body into a sacred form that radiates wisdom and compassion. By reciting the mantra OM AH HUM VAJRA GURU PADMA SIDDHI HUM, we cut through our habitual speech and invoke the power of Padmasambhava's enlightened mind. By resting in the state of mahamudra, we transcend our ordinary mind and experience the primordial awareness that is free from all dualities and limitations.
