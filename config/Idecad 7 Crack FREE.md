- **ideCAD Architectural:** This module is designed for architectural design and visualization. It allows you to create and edit 3D models of buildings with parametric components such as walls, columns, beams, floors, stairs, roofs, windows, doors, and furniture. You can also apply materials, textures, lighting, and shadows to your models. You can use the site and landscape tools to create realistic environments for your buildings. You can also generate 2D drawings and 3D views from your models automatically.
- **ideCAD Structural:** This module is designed for structural analysis and design. It allows you to create and edit 3D models of concrete and steel structures with parametric components such as beams, columns, slabs, foundations, walls, braces, trusses, and plates. You can also assign loads, supports, and boundary conditions to your models. You can perform linear and nonlinear static analysis, modal analysis, buckling analysis, seismic analysis, wind analysis, and dynamic analysis. You can also design your structures according to various codes and standards. You can also generate structural drawings and details from your models automatically.
- **ideCAD One AEC:** This module is designed for integrated building design and collaboration. It allows you to work on a common data environment with your team members and other stakeholders. You can access and edit both architectural and structural models in one platform. You can also perform coordination and clash detection between different disciplines. You can also create construction documents and reports from your models automatically.
