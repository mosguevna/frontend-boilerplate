But don't just take our word for it. The VirSyn Plugins Pack 1012012 has received rave reviews from users and experts alike. Here are some of the comments we found on the web:

> "Virsyn's Matrix Vocoder is one of the first plug-ins to use Steinberg's new VST3 specification. So if you want that classic vocoder sound, should you take the blue pill or the red one? [...] Matrix performs a spectral analysis of the modulator signal using a 32-channel filter bank and identifies the spectral energy in each channel. [...] Technical details aside, the processing also has to be efficient to allow real-time, low-latency performance. [...] Matrix version 1.1.1 also includes polyphonic support." - Sound On Sound[^1^]

> "VTape is designed to emulate the tape sound through two individual-but-related plug-ins: VTape Saturator and VTape Delay. Both share some features, such as three tape-related parameters (hiss, flutter and bias), input drive, output trim and metering, and some basic factory presets. [...] The VTape plug-ins may look unassuming and the factory presets are a bit basic, but the sound of them is what counts, and VirSyn has got this spot on." - MusicRadar[^2^]

> "Well, given that Virsyn have chosen not to include basic subtractive synthesis elements like a resonant filter or a modulation matrix, it's surprisingly versatile, and can reproduce a fair range of more or less 'analogue' sounds." - Sound On Sound[^3^]
