# COPRA RF: The Best Software for Roll Forming Design and Quality Control
 
Roll forming is a process of shaping metal sheets into desired profiles by passing them through a series of rollers. Roll forming is widely used in various industries, such as automotive, construction, aerospace, and furniture. However, roll forming is not a simple task. It requires careful design of the roll tools, accurate measurement of the roll contours, and constant monitoring of the product quality.
 
That's why you need COPRA RF, the global market leader in the field of roll forming software. COPRA RF is a comprehensive solution that covers the whole roll forming process chain and provides tailor-made software modules for tube makers and profile manufacturers alike. COPRA RF integrates seamlessly with the COPRA workflow and allows unlimited possibilities for process optimization.

With COPRA RF, you can:
 
- Design your roll tools effectively and efficiently using the powerful CAD features and the extensive library of standard shapes.
- Verify and optimize your design using the advanced finite element analysis (FEA) module that simulates the material behavior and stress distribution during roll forming.
- Measure your roll contours precisely and quickly using the COPRA RollScanner, a high-precision optical measurement system that automatically follows the outer contour of the rolls and determines a vectorized polyline.
- Manage your roll stock intelligently and economically using the COPRA RLM, a database-supported roll management solution that stores all the information about your roll tools, such as contour parameters, wear-out status, and reshaping concepts.
- Reverse engineer existing roll sets using the COPRA RollScanner and COPRA RF to extract the reshaping strategy and modify it as needed.

COPRA RF is more than just a software. It is a complete package that includes training, support, and consulting from genuine roll forming experts who have decades of experience in the industry. COPRA RF also offers regular updates and upgrades to accommodate ever-changing demands from the market.

## How COPRA RF Works
 
COPRA RF is a modular software that consists of several components that work together to provide a complete roll forming solution. Here is a brief overview of how COPRA RF works:

1. The first step is to design your roll tools using COPRA RF Sections or COPRA RF Tubes, depending on whether you are producing open or closed profiles. You can use the built-in CAD features to create your own shapes or choose from the extensive library of standard shapes. You can also import existing shapes from other CAD systems. COPRA RF Sections and COPRA RF Tubes will automatically generate the roll tool geometry and the flower pattern based on your input parameters.
2. The next step is to verify and optimize your design using COPRA FEA RF, a finite element analysis module that simulates the roll forming process and predicts the material behavior and stress distribution during deformation. COPRA FEA RF can help you avoid common problems such as buckling, twisting, springback, and edge cracking. You can also use COPRA FEA RF to optimize your design parameters, such as roll gap, forming speed, and lubrication.
3. The third step is to measure your roll contours using COPRA RollScanner, a high-precision optical measurement system that scans the outer contour of the rolls and determines a vectorized polyline. COPRA RollScanner can measure any type of roll tool, regardless of size, shape, or material. COPRA RollScanner does not require any teach-in process or programming. It automatically follows the contour of the rolls and completes the scanning process in less than a minute.
4. The fourth step is to manage your roll stock using COPRA RLM, a database-supported roll management solution that stores all the information about your roll tools, such as contour parameters, wear-out status, and reshaping concepts. COPRA RLM can help you keep track of your roll inventory and optimize your roll utilization. You can also use COPRA RLM to compare different roll sets and identify potential reuse or rework opportunities.
5. The fifth step is to reverse engineer existing roll sets using COPRA RollScanner and COPRA RF Sections or COPRA RF Tubes. You can scan the roll contours and assemble them with COPRA RF Sections or COPRA RF Tubes to extract the reshaping strategy and modify it as needed. You can also use COPRA FEA RF to verify and optimize the reverse engineered design.

COPRA RF is a flexible and powerful software that can handle any roll forming challenge. Whether you are a beginner or an expert, you can benefit from the features and functions of COPRA RF.
