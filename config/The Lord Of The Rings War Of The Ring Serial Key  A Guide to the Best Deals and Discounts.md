The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring is a real-time strategy game based on the famous fantasy saga by J.R.R. Tolkien. Released in 2003 by Sierra Entertainment and developed by Liquid Entertainment, the game allows players to control the forces of good or evil in two separate campaigns that follow the events of the books. The game features a variety of units, heroes, spells, and locations from Middle-earth, as well as a multiplayer mode that supports up to eight players.

Despite being faithful to the source material and having decent graphics and gameplay, War of the Ring did not receive much attention from critics or fans. This was partly due to the fact that it was overshadowed by another Lord of the Rings game that came out in the same year: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, which was based on the movie adaptation by Peter Jackson. Another reason was that War of the Ring was often compared to Warcraft III, a hugely popular RTS game that had a similar style and mechanics. War of the Ring was seen as a clone or a rip-off of Warcraft III, even though it was based on a different engine and had some unique features.
 
War of the Ring deserves more recognition and appreciation than it got. It is a fun and challenging game that captures the spirit and atmosphere of Tolkien's world. It has a rich and diverse roster of units and heroes, each with their own abilities and upgrades. It has a well-designed map editor that allows players to create their own scenarios and missions. It has a loyal fan base that still plays and mods the game today. And it has a nostalgic charm that makes it a classic RTS game worth revisiting.
  
One of the main attractions of War of the Ring is its gameplay, which offers a lot of strategic options and variety. The game has two modes: a story mode and a skirmish mode. The story mode consists of two campaigns: one for the Free Peoples and one for the Shadow. Each campaign has 10 missions that follow the main events of the books, such as the Battle of Helm's Deep, the Siege of Minas Tirith, and the Destruction of the Ring. The missions are not linear, and players can choose which regions to attack or defend, as well as which heroes to recruit and use. The skirmish mode allows players to create their own custom battles on any of the 25 maps available, with up to eight players or AI opponents.
 
The gameplay is based on a dice system that determines the actions that players can perform each turn. Each player has a pool of action dice that can be used to activate different types of actions, such as moving armies, mustering troops, using characters, casting spells, or using special abilities. The dice have different symbols that correspond to different actions, and some dice are more powerful than others. For example, a Palantir die can be used for any action, while a Muster die can only be used for mustering troops or advancing on the political track. The dice also have an Eye symbol that represents Sauron's influence and can trigger the Hunt for the Ring.
 
The Hunt for the Ring is a unique mechanic that simulates the perilous journey of Frodo and Sam to Mount Doom. The Free Peoples player can move the Fellowship across the map in secret, but must reveal their location when they enter a region with enemy units or strongholds. The Shadow player can try to find and capture the Ring by using Nazgul or other special units. The Hunt for the Ring is resolved by rolling dice and drawing Hunt tiles that have different effects, such as wounding or corrupting the Ring-bearers, revealing their location, or allowing them to escape. The Hunt for the Ring is crucial for both sides, as it affects the Doom track that measures how close each side is to victory.
 
War of the Ring has two main ways to win: a military victory or a ring-based victory. A military victory is achieved by conquering enough enemy regions or strongholds to reach a certain number of victory points. A ring-based victory is achieved by either destroying the Ring in Mount Doom (for the Free Peoples) or corrupting and capturing it (for the Shadow). The game also has several optional rules and variants that add more complexity and challenge to the gameplay, such as weather effects, special events, or different victory conditions.
