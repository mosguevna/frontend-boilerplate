Now, fans of the film are eagerly waiting for the sequel, The Ghazi Attack 3, which is rumored to be in the works. According to some sources, the sequel will explore another covert operation by the Indian Navy during the same war, involving a different submarine and a different target. The sequel will also feature some of the original cast members, such as Rana Daggubati, Kay Kay Menon, and Atul Kulkarni, as well as some new faces.
 
The Ghazi Attack 3 is expected to release in 2023, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the 1971 war. The film will be directed by Sankalp Reddy, who helmed the first film as well. The film will be produced by PVP Cinema and Matinee Entertainment, and will be released in Hindi, Telugu, and Tamil languages.
 
However, there is a catch. The film is not yet officially announced by the makers, and there is no confirmation on the title, the plot, or the cast of the film. The film is also likely to face some legal hurdles, as the Pakistani Navy has disputed the historical accuracy of the first film and may object to the portrayal of their forces in the sequel. Moreover, the film may also face some piracy issues, as many websites are already offering links to download The Ghazi Attack 3 full movie in full hd quality.
 
Therefore, we advise our readers to wait for the official announcement of the film and watch it only in theatres or on authorized streaming platforms. The Ghazi Attack 3 is a film that deserves to be seen on the big screen, as it will showcase the bravery and patriotism of the Indian Navy and pay tribute to the martyrs of the 1971 war.
  
The Ghazi Attack was not the only naval action that took place during the 1971 war. The Indian Navy also conducted several other operations that demonstrated its prowess and professionalism in both the eastern and western theatres of war. Some of these operations are briefly described below.
 
In the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Navy launched Operation Jackpot, a daring commando raid on Pakistani ports and shipping. On the night of August 15, 1971, a group of Indian naval frogmen, led by Lieutenant Commander Inderjit Sharma, planted limpet mines on several Pakistani ships anchored at Chittagong harbour. The explosions sank or damaged eight ships and created panic among the Pakistani authorities. Similar raids were carried out by other naval teams at Mongla, Chandpur, and Narayanganj in the following months.
 
Another major operation in the eastern theatre was Operation Cactus Lily, which involved the deployment of INS Vikrant and its air group in the Bay of Bengal. The aircraft carrier, escorted by two frigates and two submarines, sailed from Visakhapatnam on November 22, 1971, and reached a position off Cox's Bazar on December 4. From there, Vikrant's Sea Hawk fighters and Alize anti-submarine aircraft launched repeated strikes on Pakistani airfields, radar stations, gun positions, and ships along the East Pakistan coast. The air strikes destroyed or damaged 15 Pakistani aircraft on the ground and sank or crippled 10 ships in the harbour. The operation also provided air cover for the Indian Army's amphibious landing at Cox's Bazar on December 8.

In the Arabian Sea, the Indian Navy carried out two audacious missile attacks on Karachi, Pakistan's main port and naval base. The first attack, code-named Operation Trident, took place on the night of December 4/5, 1971. A task force of three missile boats (INS Nipat, Nirghat, and Veer), escorted by two frigates (INS Kiltan and Katchall) and a tanker (INS Poshak), sailed from Okha on December 3 and reached a position about 70 nautical miles south of Karachi on December 4. From there, they launched their Styx missiles at Karachi harbour and its surrounding oil installations. The missiles hit their targets with devastating accuracy, sinking a Pakistani destroyer (PNS Khaibar), a minesweeper (PNS Muhafiz), and a merchant ship (MV Venus Challenger), and setting fire to several oil tanks. The Pakistani Navy was caught off guard by the surprise attack and failed to intercept or retaliate against the Indian task force.
 
The second attack, code-named Operation Python, took place on the night of December 8/9, 1971. This time, two missile boats (INS Vinash and Nipat), escorted by a frigate (INS Talwar) and a tanker (INS Poshak), repeated the feat of Operation Trident. They fired their missiles at Karachi harbour from a distance of about 40 nautical miles and scored hits on a Pakistani destroyer (PNS Shah Jahan), a cargo ship (MV Harmattan), and an oil tanker (MV Gulf Star). The attack also caused further damage to the oil tanks and facilities at Karachi.
 
The two missile attacks on Karachi were a masterstroke of naval planning and execution. They inflicted heavy losses on the Pakistani Navy and disrupted its supply lines and communications. They also boosted the morale of the Indian Navy and showcased its technological edge over its adversary.
