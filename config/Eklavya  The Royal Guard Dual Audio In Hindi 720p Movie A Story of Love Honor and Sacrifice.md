## The Plot of Eklavya - The Royal Guard
 
The film begins with Eklavya receiving a letter from Harshwardhan, informing him that he is coming back to Devigarh after studying abroad. Eklavya is overjoyed to see his master's son, whom he considers as his own. However, he is unaware that Harshwardhan has a hidden agenda: he wants to expose the truth about his father's death and his mother's affair with Eklavya.
 
Meanwhile, Pannalal Chohar arrives in Devigarh to investigate the murder of Rana Jaywardhan (Boman Irani), the king's brother and Harshwardhan's uncle. He suspects that Eklavya is involved in the crime, as he was seen near the crime scene. He also learns that Rana Jaywardhan was plotting to overthrow the king and take over the throne.
 
As the film progresses, Eklavya discovers that he is not only the royal guard but also the biological father of Harshwardhan. He had an affair with Rani Suhasinidevi (Sharmila Tagore), the queen, when she was unhappy with her marriage to Rana Jyotiwardhan (Rajesh Vivek), the king. Rana Jyotiwardhan was aware of this fact and died of a heart attack after confronting Eklavya.
 
Eklavya is torn between his loyalty to the royal family and his love for his son. He also has to face the wrath of Pannalal Chohar, who wants to arrest him for murder. The film reaches a climax when Harshwardhan confronts Eklavya and accuses him of killing his father and ruining his mother's life. Eklavya tries to explain his side of the story but Harshwardhan does not listen. He shoots Eklavya in the chest and leaves him to die.

Eklavya - The Royal Guard is a film that has a lot of potential but fails to deliver on its promise. The film has a complex and intriguing plot but suffers from poor execution and pacing. The film tries to be a mix of drama, action, romance, and mystery but ends up being confusing and inconsistent.
